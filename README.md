=== Random Password Generator ===

=== About ===
I made a random password generator using JS for homework.

I was supplied with the html, css and a very small amount of JS (line 1 for example).

I first created variables for different kinds of texts - lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

I then made a "result' array that I used in the function as a master array to gather all of the characters from the other arrays, if the user chose to add those characters into their password.

I created a function called generatePassword in which all of the logic? or coding went into.

The first part of the variable lets the user tell the program how many characters long they would like their random password to be- between 8 and 128 characters.

I used "let XYZvariable = confirm" to give a popup window for the user to make a choice with. The choices are between using certain characters in their password or not. The user should click 'OK' if they do, and 'Cancel' if they do not wish to use that type of character.

At the bottom of the function i used a for statement to do some math and come up with the password.

=== who i worked with ===
Taylor Garrey and Emily Burger and I worked in a zoom call together while doing our homework.
I also used countless online resources to figure out how to make my code run.
